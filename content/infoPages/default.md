Hi there, thanks for looking up my personal space on the web. Since you asked, I've been designing digital products for startups and large enterprises in London, the Netherlands and Hong Kong for about 15 years now.

My core focus has always been visual design and user experience, but along the way I've picked up valuable knowledge around UX copy writing, CRO, SEO, marketing and some development.

I love creating high fidelity prototypes and getting to results fast. Imho, this is the best way to test and launch a successful product.
