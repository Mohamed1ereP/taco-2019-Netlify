I've been designing digital products for startups to large enterprises for over 10 years in both London and Hong Kong.

While my core focus has always been visual design, branding and user experience, along the way I've picked up valuable knowledge around CRO, SEO, marketing and copywriting.

Keeping your business' goals front and centre is crucial to the success of the product.
