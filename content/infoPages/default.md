### Hello!

I'm a digital design lead with experience leading design teams in London and Hong Kong.

I feel lucky to live in these exciting times when it comes to digital design; startups are devising design systems, design tools are getting [better](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/sketch-58-smart-layout-117616e6c241) and [better](https://www.framer.com/) and design thinking permeates all kinds of businesses. Our digital lives are changing by the minute and I am glad to be working with [people who are at the forefront](https://chengbao.com.hk/).

### Background

I studied [illustration](https://dribbble.com/tkdo) at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. During my studies I spent some time in Los Angeles, USA and soon after graduating I moved to London, UK. I learned design and branding from some the best in the business, but moved on to working for a number of tech startups in the first half of the 2010s.
