## As you might have guessed, I believe in rapid prototyping. The sooner we get something that (almost) behaves and functions like the real thing, the better.

I am a Digital Design Lead with experience ellevating the best teams in London and Hong Kong. Putting my clients' users first allows me to have a clear vision, informed by business goals and brand values.

## Hands-free cooking

The conversational UI of the [BBC Good Food Alexa skill](/bbc-good-food), which allows users to follow recipes distraction-free.

## The future of automotion

With Fitch Hong Kong I lead the UX and UI design of challenger brand Bordrin, carving its space in the increasingly crowded Chinese Electric Vehicle landscape.

## Telling the stories that matter

With family storytelling startup Kindeo I redesigned the iPad appâ€™s navigation and sharing site, as well as designing new features including text and photo input.

## Frictionless payment

With a few friends I set up #PAY, a frictionless payment service that integrates with Twitter. Users can set up an account and donate to their favourite charities with a tweet.
