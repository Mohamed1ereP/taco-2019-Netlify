## As you might have guessed, I believe in rapid prototyping. The sooner we get something that (almost) behaves and functions like the real thing, the better.

I am a Digital Design Director with experience leading the best teams in London and Hong Kong. I try to get the best out of the people I work with in order to deliver the best products for my clients.
