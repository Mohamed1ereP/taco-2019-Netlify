## As you might have guessed, I believe in rapid prototyping. The sooner we get something that (almost) behaves and functions like the real thing, the better.

I am a Digital Design Lead with experience ellevating the best teams in London and Hong Kong. Putting my clients' users first allows me to have a clear vision, informed by business goals and brand values.
