## Bordrin is an ambitious new brand in the Electric Vehicle landscape in China.

For [Fitch Hong Kong](https://www.fitch.com) I led the team that designed Bordrin's digital platform. This involved a small V-team of myself, a UX designer and a core team at Bordrin to take the amazing work the brand team at Fitch was doing in tandem and distill that into a phased release of MVP â†’ Launch â†’ e-commerce ðŸŽ‰

As Bordrin is an ambitious new company, the website's main aims are to:

* establish a strong identity
* showcase the brand's vehicles
* show the cars' superior tech

We designed a website structure that lays out the proposition clearly, and holds no punches as to the company's vision: dedicated pages for two flagship cars, a brand and culture section, a blog and a careers page. 

Pretty simple really, but it's all the site needs â†’ we took great care to make it as concise as possible.
