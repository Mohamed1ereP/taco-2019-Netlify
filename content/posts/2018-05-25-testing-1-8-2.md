## Bordrin is an ambitious new brand in the Electric Vehicle landscape in China.

For [Fitch Hong Kong](https://www.fitch.com) I led the team that designed Bordrin's digital platform. This involved a small V-team of myself, a UX designer and a core team at Bordrin to take the amazing work the brand team at Fitch was doing in tandem and distill that into a phased release of MVP â†’ Launch â†’ e-commerce ðŸŽ‰

As Bordrin is an ambitious new company, the website's main aims are to establish a strong identity that confidently showcases the company's vehicles and its superior tech.

For phase 1 we designed a website structure that lays out the proposition clearly, featured dedicated pages for their flagship cars, a brand and culture section, a blog and a careers page.
