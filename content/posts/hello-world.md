excerpt: >
  Le Chameau makes boots for people who live and breathe the land. They’ve been
  hand making rubber boots since 1927 in the same factory in Normandy, France.
  With Dave’s Lab I designed their e-commerce site and worked on the company’s
  branding.


  Le Chameau’s boots have an understated luxury to them and are worn by people
  who love what they do. So it only made sense to treat the website with the
  same attention to detail and love of life.
