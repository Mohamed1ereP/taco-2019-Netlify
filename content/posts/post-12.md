## No more salsa-stained, garlic-smelling recipe books

At [Hi Mum! Said Dad](www.himumsaiddad.com) I had the daunting task to design the conversational UI of one of Britain's most loved recipe sources.

This was an amazing opportunity to redefine not only BBC Good Food's cookbook, but also how we think about cooking entirely. Asking ”give me a vegetarian recipe for 6“ is an incredible improvement on finding your laptop, opening it, typing in your password, opening Safari and typing BBC Good Food, clicking on the relevant link, filter by vegetarian and scroll through the listing.

I likened the user flow of a conversational UI as the reverse of a general app flow. Rather than a single starting point that leads to every part of the app, a conversational UI has a hundred starting points that lead to a single recipe.

It was a truly rewarding experience designing the voice skill with the team at HMSD, and it deservedly got nominated for a Webby for Best User Experience in 2019.
