World-renowned beauty brand Olay asked us to come up with a tool that showcases their proprietary skin-care algorithm and would appeal to high-demanding, digitally savvy Chinese teens.

We designed an Augmented Reality app that analyzes their user's unique skin to their geo-location, informing them what they need according to their circomstances.

If they are travelling Olay would be able to recommend the perfect product to alleviate dry air, and if they had had a big night out, the app is able to propose a regimen that alleviates the damage done.

The below is a prototype that showcases a typical journey, from onboarding to action.
